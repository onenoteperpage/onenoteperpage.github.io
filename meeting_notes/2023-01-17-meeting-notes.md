<!-- _**Note:** Qube is Horizon (Qube Vision, and Qube Horizon)_ -->

1. Discuss what has worked and what didn’t for you
1. What items you think that should've been addressed by other teams _(eg - support/products)_
1. What improvements do you think that we need – as a team as well as processes
1. What are the top 3 things that frustrated/ing you the most
1. What are the things you believe we are not doing well.
1. What are the changes you want to see in 2023


## What Did/Didn't Work?
- Missing central repository for documentation, mostly what is known is tribal knowledge that can be lost when people leave
  - Can we have a running ticket where there is a dynamic list that we can add items to, and people can knock them off when they have time, submit it to the end-of-month review, and get it accepted by the team and formalised?
- Config/setup of environments has taken quite some time to establish as a comprehension of landscape
- Missing framework-at-a-glance associated with each product/client
  - Who is the consultant?
  - What is the contact person from the client?
  - What are the associated environments that this uses?
  - What is the current version? _(This ties into process/documentation)_
  - Are there any anomalies that apply to this config/setup?


## Items To Address
- No notes to add at this stage from me


## Improvements Needed (Team Inclusive Too)
- Have a face-2-face day each month for the IT department where everyone comes to the office as a once a month
- Structured process for each particular solution, that can be taken as a staple for the organisation
- Someone who specialises in SQL/DB


## Top 3 Frustrations
- Timing around scheduling of tasks from consultants (4-6 day lead time)
- Additions/changes to scheduled tasks that have been added to calendar (changes cannot be made once accepted and scheduled)
- Missing knowledge around new/other products in the organisation - at the moment they are just words on a screen and faces in meetings that talk about the product – screenshots, demonstrations, walk throughs


## We Don't Do Well
- Utilise automation to trigger/action tasks as part of deployments, that could prevent tasks from being managed manually
- Standardise documentation of processes so that all knowledge can be transferred to new staff joining the organisation without having to _bog-down_ a staff member, and give a ledge that can be reached by new joiner
- Server patching/security and maintenance
- Missing CAB for monthly tasks that should be carried out across all our infrastructure


## Changes To See In 2023
- To steal the terminology Parthy used, we are at the "start-up stage" in APAC IT, we can use this opportunity to put together a plan and set up quarterly milestones to achieve our goals of being a recognisable brand, independent of US and UK
- Get to the point where on December 24th, 2023, we don't have to hear the words _"we need the US/UK to do that, because we don't have access"_
- See my team start to work autonomously as a whole and start taking opportunities to work independent of Parthy and carry out strategy alongside our BAU circling back to Parthy for updates/info
